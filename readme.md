The MS-DOS port was once reviewed as the worst example of how bad Shareware can be (and I /really/ wish I remembered by who so I could give them credit), but now you can see exactly what made it tick!

For what it's worth, /I/ never thought it was that bad. It's as amusing as any other ski game, and mine has missiles.

Both TI and the later MS-DOS version are included here. The TI version also has a 32k cartridge available.
